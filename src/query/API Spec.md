# The generic query service API gets designed from the ground up

_Introductions:_

- The interface should not depend on the specific version of the YDB and the mode of
  running it: cloud, local or otherwise.

- It is desirable that the interface should be close in spirit to other database TS (JS) APIs, so that
  the transition to YDB would be comfortable.

- There is no need to repeat the YDB API for other languages, as TypeScript is a language with
  its own specific features. For example, passing named parameters.

_Rules:_

- Like in any good API, rules for checking parameters and default values to be used should be
  formulated and implemented in code.

- A session must not allow a transaction to be created if the transaction is already open.

_Query API on other languages:_

- [.Net](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-dotnet-sdk/tree/main/src/Ydb.Sdk/src/Services/Query)

- [Go (draft)](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/tree/query-client-interface/query)

_Features:_

- Execute simple query, without a transaction.

- Execute multiple queries in a transaction.

- Execute multiple queries without a transaction, but with a guarantee that the result
  will be only if no critical errors occur during execution.

- Execute multiple queries in different transactions, but with a guarantee that the result
  will be only if no critical errors occur during execution.

- Repeat the operation several times, each with a new session in case of an error, according to the repeat policy.

- Specify the type of transaction when it is needed.

- Specify trace id for end-to-end trace collection.

- Optionally, have a repeat policy that tells to execute in an internal YDB session (no session id passing to YDB).
  Ð¡an optimize execution time with loss of information for the balancing. Can be useful
  for _serverless functions_ where query execution time is critical.

_Technical details:_

- User code must be passed as a lambda function:

  - This ensures that transactions and sessions are closed at the end of its execution.

  - Allow the operation to be re-executed in case of an error.

  - It makes possible to measure time for tracing.

  - Universally log errors that occur.

- A common session pool code with table service must be used. But for the time of API development it is OK to have
  a duplicate of the session pool interfaces in the query folder.

_Important:_

- When developing the Query API, check if a similar API can be made for Table Service in the future.
